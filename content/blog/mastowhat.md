Hi all, and welcome to another blog post. Today I'm going to explain a little bit about Mastodon and a generic explanation of the Fediverse as a whole. Mastodon is an interesting software and the Fediverse is a wonderful concept, so without further ado, lets dive straight in!

## Mastodon
According to Wikipedia: 
> Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. It has microblogging features similar to Twitter, which are offered by a large number of independently run nodes, known as instances, each with its own code of conduct, terms of service, privacy policy, privacy options, and content moderation policies.

Mastodon is a FOSS software that offers microblogging and social media features to users across numerous servers (instances). These servers can "federate" with others and with other apps using the same system called ActivityPub.

## Federation
When I say federation I don't mean the Star Wars Trade Federation, I mean what is in essence a bridge between islands. Think of each individual ActivityPub instance as an island, if two instances federate they build a bridge between them.
